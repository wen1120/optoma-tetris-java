The Contributors License Agreement
==========================================

Version 1.0
-----------

### Preface

This Agreement is between You, the Users, the Contributors, and Optoma. The intent of the Agreement is to clarify your responsibilities as a Contributor.

The Agreement is meant to protect You, the Users, the Contributors,
and Optoma from the malicious misdeeds of others.
The Agreement is *not* intended to restrict how You use Your own
Contributions.

The Agreement is written in plain English to be easily understood by
You and all those affected by it. The terms defined below and used
throughout this document are capitalized in order to reduce ambiguity,
but they should be understood to have their usual colloquial meaning
and the singular shall include the plural.

### Definitions

1. "Agreement" &mdash; This document.

2. "You" / "Your" &mdash; The individual signing this Agreement.

3. "Optoma Ltd" &mdash; The company which manages the
   Projects. The company's website is at <http://www.optoma.com/>.

4. "Project" &mdash; Open source projects being managed by Optoma. Our Projects may all be found at
   <https://github.com/Optoma>

5. "Contribution" &mdash; Code, content, and ideas
   that are meant to be integrated into Projects. Issues (bug report)
   and pull requests (suggestions to integrate content) filed on a
   Project are implicitly Contributions, unless they clearly state
   up-front, "This is not a contribution." Contributions may take
   other forms as well, including (but not limited to) email or other
   more general communication intended to be received by one or more
   Contributors.

6. "Contributor" &mdash; Those people and
   corporations that provide Contributions.

7. "User" &mdash; Those people and companies which make use of the
   Projects. Making use of a Project includes (but is not limited to)
   compiling and/or running its content, taking some action which
   causes its content to be used, copying its content, distributing
   its content, modifying its content, and even taking its content
   and/or ideas for a less direct purpose.


### Licensing Agreement

When You provide a Contribution to a Project:

* You assert that the Contribution was authored by You.

* You license that Contribution under the terms of the
  license of that Project. More specifically, You grant an irrevocable
  license for Your Contribution to the Users, the Contributors, and
  Optoma.

* You assert that You have the authority and are able to license Your
  Contribution under the license of that Project.

* If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create
  which may include Your Contribution, then You assert that Your
  employer has granted You explicit permission to license the Contribution
  on behalf of Your employer.

Furthermore:

* You assert that You have the authority and are able to enter into this
  Agreement.

* If You become aware of a problem with any of Your Contributions or
  with the fact that You have signed this Agreement, then You agree to
  inform Optoma about the problem, without any undue
  delay.
